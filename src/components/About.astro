          I previously worked as a brewer before deciding to change careers and
          went back to university to pursue a degree in Philosophy where I
          discovered a passion for problem-solving, logic and creative thinking.
          My interest in problem solving and logic led me to software
          development and I made the decision to study at Enspiral Dev Academy
          where I learnt the foundations of web development.
